# BusyTom
 Minimalist Responsive To-Do List in Node.js

![Alt text](https://github.com/TMarski/BusyTom/blob/main/BusyTom_demo.gif?raw=true "BusyTom Demo")


Are you tired of tracking your to-do list across two paper notebooks, a Reminders app, and an Evernote document? Do you also believe that there's no need to spend $7.99 per month on a premium productivity app which is bloated with sluggish UI features? Have you also wondered why this problem couldn't just be solved with a self-hosted Javascript app in a Docker container on your home server?

I am developing this minimalist web app to include only the features I need, to help me keep track of everything I need to do - although you're more than welcome to try it out too. This is primarily a learning-experiece project to familiarize myself both with Node.js and to learn some prompt engineering skills to push ChatGPT through pair-programming a project from start to finish. 

## Features

  -  A light-weight web app for adding tasks
  -  Add multiple sub-tasks to a parent task, in order to track progress on multi-step tasks
  -  A responsive Ajax front-end, allowing you to drag tasks to reorganize your list
  -  A complete lack of authentication or encryption (in other words, do not use this in production environments or to note sensitive data)
